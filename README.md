The system matches the keywords from Job description dictonaries to applicants' resume and predicts the job category with confidence score.

## Files
- "ATS.py" : Contains Neural Network class
- "trainATS.py" : Data preprocessing, text extraction and training neural network.
- "testATS.py" : loads the trained model and predicts job category with confidence score.
